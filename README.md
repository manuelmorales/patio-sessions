# Patio Sessions

A sandbox sessions microservice.
Not for real use.

The intention of this microservice is to explore object oriented design ideas like 
single responsibility principle, inversion of control, duck typing and friends.
This is all just experiments, expect the design to be cumbersome and brittle.


## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.org:manuelmorales/patio-sessions.git

./cli # to show help
```
